# WEB_POE_PART_3
Sweet Cravings Bakery – A responsive website showcasing handmade cakes, pastries, and breads with interactive product listings, live search, and a dynamic order enquiry form.

This is the updated version of the Sweet Cravings Bakery website, developed as part of my Web Development (WEDE 5020) assignment – Part 3.
The main goal of this update was to enhance user interaction and product display, while practicing JavaScript DOM manipulation, dynamic content rendering, and improved form handling.
